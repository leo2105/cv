### Projects

`April 2018 - December 2018`
__Car Monitoring System by Mini-Robot using Artificial Intelligence in Underground garage__

As lider of project, we built an small autonomous car using NVIDIA TX1, Arduino and cameras. Deep Learning was used for image-based self-driving in underground garage, cars detection and license plate recognition. And, using Beacon sensors for Triangulation Based Localization of parking lots.

`May - November 2018`
__Small Autonomous Vehicle For IEEE LARC Competition__

As lider of the project, we developed an small autonomous ground vehicle for the LARC IEEE OPEN 2018. Using turtlebot burger modifying its hardware and software to pick up, drop down and carry little steel boxes to specific areas.


### Posters
